## Overview

This activity fulfills Stage 2, Requirement 3 of the Digital Maker Staged Activity Badge (Make a simple digital creation that uses code to interact with the wider world through inputs (such as buttons or typing on a keyboard) and outputs (such as a computer screen, sound, or lights.))

Young people will make a 'Do it; pass it' game using the BBC micro:bit. Players will need to perform an action shown on the micro:bit and then pass the micro:bit on to the next person. When the timer runs out the group will see their score and can keep playing to try and beat it. 

## Information 

+ Time - 30-60 minutes (plus time to play the game) 
+ Group size -  Flexible (ideally two young people per computer); Larger groups can play the game
+ Preparation needed - If you’re running this activity without access to WiFi, you will need to download the software
ahead of time. You may also wish to print handouts 
+ Location - Wherever you have access to computers. The game can be played indoors or outdoors.

## You will need

Per pair
+ Computers or mobile devices
+ BBC micro:bit
+ One USB A to micro USB B cable for programming (not needed for mobile devices)
+ Battery pack and batteries
+ One crocodile clip lead (not essential)
+ Activity handouts

### If your meeting place has WiFi

Run the micro:bit MakeCode editor in a web browser using this link: rpf.io/makecode.

### If your meeting place doesn’t have WiFi

Download the micro:bit MakeCode app beforehand (Windows only); refer to the micro:bit guide rpf.io/scouts-microbit for instructions.

## Key messages

+ Computers interact with the world through inputs and outputs
+ Inputs such as pressing a button send information into a computer
+ Outputs such as a display screen send information out of a computer
+ The BBC micro:bit is a small computer with built-in inputs and a display of 25 LED lights. You can also connect additional inputs and outputs to the micro:bit using its pins (labelled 0, 1 and 2).

## Alternatives

+ You can use the MakeCode simulator to create the project if you don't have access to micro:bit devices. 

## Safety

If the young people are working online, tell them to ask for permission before viewing any other websites. It’s a good idea to set up parental controls — you can find instructions for this on the NSPCC website (rpf.io/scouts-nspcc-online).

You should also give each young person a Stay Safe leaflet (rpf.io/scouts-staysafe).

## Adaptability

+ The project is staged so young people do not have to complete later steps to have a complete game. 
+ Young people with more advanced coding skills could create the same project using JavaScript in the MakeCode editor or Python with the Mu editor.
