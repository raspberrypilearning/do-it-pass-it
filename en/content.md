# Leader notes

## Overview

This activity fulfills Stage 3, Requirement 2 of the Digital Maker Staged Activity Badge (Use a programmable device (such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or micro:bit) with electronic components, code, and appropriate materials to create an electronic gadget and use it in a Scouting activity.)

Young people will make a 'Do it; pass it' game using the BBC micro:bit. Players will need to perform an action shown on the micro:bit and then pass the micro:bit on to the next person. When the timer runs out the group will see their score and can keep playing to try and beat it. 

## Information 

+ Time - 30-60 minutes (plus time to play the game) 
+ Group size -  Flexible (ideally two young people per computer); Larger groups can play the game
+ Preparation needed - If you’re running this activity without access to WiFi, you will need to download the software
ahead of time. You may also wish to print handouts 
+ Location - Wherever you have access to computers. The game can be played indoors or outdoors.

## You will need

Per pair
+ Computers or mobile devices
+ BBC micro:bit
+ One USB A to micro USB B cable for programming (not needed for mobile devices)
+ Battery pack and batteries
+ One crocodile clip lead (not essential)
+ A torch
+ Activity handouts

### If your meeting place has WiFi

Run the micro:bit MakeCode editor in a web browser using this link: rpf.io/makecode.

### If your meeting place doesn’t have WiFi

Download the micro:bit MakeCode app beforehand (Windows only); refer to the micro:bit guide rpf.io/scouts-microbit for instructions.

## Key messages

+ Computers interact with the world through inputs and outputs
+ Inputs such as pressing a button send information into a computer
+ Outputs such as a display screen send information out of a computer
+ The BBC micro:bit is a small computer with built-in inputs and a display of 25 LED lights. You can also connect additional inputs and outputs to the micro:bit using its pins (labelled 0, 1 and 2).

## Alternatives

+ You can use the MakeCode simulator to create the project if you don't have access to micro:bit devices. 

## Safety

If the young people are working online, tell them to ask for permission before viewing any other websites. It’s a good idea to set up parental controls — you can find instructions for this on the NSPCC website (rpf.io/scouts-nspcc-online).

You should also give each young person a Stay Safe leaflet (rpf.io/scouts-staysafe).

## Adaptability

+ The project is staged so young people do not have to complete later steps to have a complete game. 
+ Young people with more advanced coding skills could create the same project using JavaScript in the MakeCode editor or Python with the Mu editor.

## Community and sharing

+ Why not take your finished games to a district Scout camp and encourage other sections to earn their Digital Making badge.

## Leader Instructions

+ If they have not used them before, introduce the young people to the micro:bit. Explain that micro:bits not only have two buttons
(for input) and a small LED display (for output), they also have sensors such as a light sensor and an accelerometer that can detect movement. Also point out the pins (labelled 0, 1, 2) that can be used to connect additional inputs and outputs.

+ Explain that young people will be creating a game that can be played in a circle at camp or just for fun. They will program the micro:bit to display images that correspond to actions they must perform such as pressing a button or shining a light. Each player must perform an action and then pass the micro:bit to the next player. The goal is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out. 

+ If the young people have not used the micro:bit with MakeCode before, demonstrate the editor and show them how to connect the micro:bit with a USB cable and download a program. Explain that blocks are colour-coded to make them easy to find.

+ Get the young people to open the MakeCode editor on their own computers and connect their micro:bits. 

+ Let them work through the rest of the instructions. 

+ As pairs finish they can try out their game and join others to make larger groups. 

+ Close with a reminder that we interact with computers though inputs and outputs and a discussion about how it felt to make their own electronic game rather than just buying one. Can they think of other games that they could make that would fit in with Scouting activities?
