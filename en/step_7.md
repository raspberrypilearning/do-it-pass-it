## What next?

You can add more input actions and more outputs to the game if you like. 

Ideas to try:

+ Experiment with different gestures such as tilt and logo up. You'll need to come up with your own images and remember what they mean.

+ Add actions for tapping on different pins with the crocodile clip lead (you can leave the other end connected to GND).

+ Can you use the magnetometer sensor to detect when a magnet or magnetic object comes near the micro:bit.

+ What about using the compass reading? 

+ Or the temperature sensor - could you move the micro:bit closer to the camp fire? Be careful!

+ How about adding different outputs. You could light up a green LED when you complete an action, or add a buzzer for sound effects.
